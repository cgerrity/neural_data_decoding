"""Two-stage training lifecycle orchestrator.

Mirrors the decision tree in ``cgg_trainAllAutoEncoder_v2.m:171-221``:

* **Stage 1 — Unsupervised pre-training** of encoder+decoder only. The
  classifier is *deliberately not built* (``cgg_trainNetwork`` is called
  with no classifier argument, setting ``HasClassifier=false`` and skipping
  all classification forward/backward code). Runs for
  ``NumEpochsAutoEncoder`` epochs.
* **Stage 2 — Supervised fine-tuning** with the classifier built on top of
  the encoder's optimal pre-training weights. Runs for ``NumEpochsFull``
  epochs.

Current production "Optimal" has ``NumEpochsAutoEncoder=0`` so Stage 1 is
degenerate — but the orchestrator MUST handle the general case so future
configs can re-enable it. Critical Note #1 spells this out.

For **Milestone A** (Logistic Regression) only Stage 2 runs — there is no
encoder/decoder pair to pre-train. ``NumEpochsAutoEncoder`` is forced to 0
in the Milestone A config.

The fit loop here owns:

* Iterating epochs with the resume offset from
  :func:`~neural_data_decoding.training.checkpoint.load_current_checkpoint`.
* Calling :func:`~neural_data_decoding.training.loop.train_one_epoch` then
  :func:`~neural_data_decoding.training.loop.validate`.
* Persisting the Current snapshot every epoch (resume safety) and the
  Optimal snapshot whenever validation accuracy improves.

It does **not** own:

* Curriculum schedules (Milestone C — will be passed in as a callback).
* W&B / monitor logging (Milestone A: print to stdout; later milestones
  will add a logger argument).
* Confidence / VAE / multi-stage loss components (Milestone C+).

        loss_weights={"classification": 1.0},
        checkpoint_dir=results_dir,
    )
    print(history[-1].val.accuracy)

        Validation metrics from :func:`validate`. ``None`` when validation

    Resume semantics: if ``checkpoint_dir`` already contains a Current
    snapshot, weights are loaded from it and training resumes at
    ``state.epoch + 1`` (Critical Note #2 — Resume reads Current, never
    Optimal). The optimizer is **not** restored (Critical Note #3 — the
    MATLAB pipeline intentionally drops optimizer state to keep checkpoint
    sizes manageable, so the first iteration after resume effectively
    restarts ``AdamW``'s moments from zero).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Module to train. Modified in-place. For Milestone A this is the
        classifier; for Milestone B+ it's the composite encoder + classifier.
    train_loader
        Iterates the training-split minibatches.
    val_loader
        Iterates the validation-split minibatches. May be ``None`` (then
        validation is skipped — Stage 1 unsupervised use case).
    optimizer
        Already constructed. Use ``AdamW`` for the Milestone A defaults.
    num_epochs
        Target total epochs (NOT additional epochs — if resuming, only the
        remaining gap is run).
    device
        Where to put tensors.
    loss_weights
        Per-component weight dict (see :mod:`losses.multi_objective`).
    checkpoint_dir
        Directory for the Current and Optimal snapshots. Created if missing.
        Pre-flight checks should have already validated that running here
        won't silently clobber a previous run (Critical Note #22 — that
        check is the caller's responsibility, not this function's).
    class_weights_per_dim
        Inverse-frequency class weights. Compute once before calling fit
        and pass through.
    grad_clip_norm
        Global L2 gradient-norm threshold. ``None`` disables clipping.
    epoch_callback
        Optional hook called after each epoch with the populated
        :class:`EpochHistory`. Useful for W&B logging, schedule updates,
        early stopping in later milestones.

    Returns
    -------
    list of EpochHistory
        One entry per epoch executed in this call (excludes epochs already
        completed in a prior interrupted run).

    Notes
    -----
    Optimal (best-validation) snapshots are written only when
    ``val_loader`` is provided and the new validation accuracy strictly
    beats the previous best. The Current snapshot is written every epoch
    regardless, so resume always works.
